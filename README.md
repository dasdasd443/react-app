# Functionality Notes

Home - nothing special, add to cart and add to favorites work on the best sellers page on items hover. You can view the individual product page of each item by clicking the name.

Store - currently uses the default product "Beats headset", update quantity, add to cart, and add to favorites does not work.

Accessories - working, you can view more details of each product by clicking the name. It will redirect to the individual product page.

Checkout - Now starts empty, you can add items via the home page bestsellers, on the accessories page, and through the individual product page.

Individual Products Page - You can view this page by clicking the name of each product. You can change quantity, add to cart, and add to favorites on this page. The amount of quantity on the page now reflects on the checkout page and its appropriate prices when added to cart.

# Changelog

1. Added loading animations when calling the fakestore API, npm package for loading animation used is the react-loadingg
2. Home, Accessories, and Individual products page now calls the API to get data when the current product list is empty. It is only called once so that the website will not call the API everytime the user goes to another page.
3. Updated the functionalities of each individual product page.
4. the product page on Store is not functioning (substituted by the individual products page). The real individual product page is accessed by clicking the name of a product.
6. Add to cart and add to favorites are functioning. Items added to cart can be viewed through the checkout page. Favorite items cannot be viewed, but it can be known if you favorite an item by checking the heart icon. If it is red, then it is a favorite item and vice versa.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
